**Animation. Planning to use this https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/wiki/Source:-AnimatedSprite 
**Convex shapes. Still need to work on resizing convex shapes and getting the size of the bounding box.
**Text. Need to think about how text should be dealt with when it is a physics object.
*Make more complex physics objects easier to create.
Resource manager to help manage loaded files better so you don't accidently load the same file multiple times.
*Complete all the other TODOs in the source files.
Think about ways to multi-thread the engine.
*Fix shakey moving objects. I think this is specific to the movement method in the tutorial though. i.e. applying the force to achieve a specific velocity each frame.
*There was another bug in one of my test games when the sf::view's position was very far from 0 (negative or positive), the camera would shake. Only if the object was moving. Or maybe the camera's position was slightly different than the objects position each frame?
Add a namespace to S2D.
**Get S2D working on Linux and create CMake file.
